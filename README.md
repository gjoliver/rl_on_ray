# RL on Ray

RL on Ray is a minimum set of skeletons needed to implement a simple RL stack on Ray.

Things demonstrated here include:
* Basic distributed rollout.
* Training loop and weight syncing.
* Basic simulator fault tolerance.

Plug in your favorite NN training framework to get a simple on-policy RL stack going.
